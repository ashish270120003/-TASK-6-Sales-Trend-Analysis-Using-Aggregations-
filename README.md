# TASK 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

## 📊 Objective
Analyze monthly revenue and order volume from the `online_sales` dataset using SQL aggregation functions.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)

## 🔍 What I Did
- Extracted month and year from the `order_date` column.
- Grouped data by month and year to analyze time trends.
- Used `SUM(amount)` to calculate monthly revenue.
- Used `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` to determine monthly order volume.
- Sorted and limited results to identify trends and top-performing months.

## 📁 Files Included
- `SQL script.sql`: SQL script containing all queries.
- ``: Output of the analysis (if applicable).
- Screenshots (if any).
